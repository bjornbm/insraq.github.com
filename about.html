Currently, I live in Helsinki (Finland) and make games in a game studio. Before that, I worked in a [game
engine](http://unity3d.com) company, started my own investment banking and technology (or *fintech* if you
will) [*startup*](https://alpha.huaxing.com/) and worked in a [Suisse investment bank](http://credit-suisse.com).

I love writing code. I started to program in middle school before doing it professionally. After moving to product
management and tech lead, I've decided to go back to coding, as a game developer.

I attended [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk) with a degree in Business (and two minors
in Computer Science and Statistics). I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/insraq), [Github](https://github.com/insraq)
and[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-sun/27/6b6/b8). I can also be reach by email *hi AT ruoyusun DOT com*
