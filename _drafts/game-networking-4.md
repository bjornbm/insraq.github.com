Part IV: **Server and Network Topology**

## Physical Server

Let's first be clear with the terminology. The server referred to in this post means "physical server". Please do not confuse with the commonly used "client/server" term â€“ that describes a game synchronization model and the "server" in "client/server" can actually be one of the game client (i.e. host). We have been using the term "authoritative node" to describe that.

## Peer to Peer vs. Central Server
